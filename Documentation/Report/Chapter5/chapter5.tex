\chapter{Relevance to the degree}
My degree scheme primary focus is to teach programming for the embedded and micro devices with limited processing power and hardware capabilities. It also focuses on teaching the right hardware choice for a particular task.

This project perfectly suited my degree scheme. It had both hardware and software parts. My work involved dealing with the micro computer with limited power capabilities. It had stages where I needed to learn different interface connections such $I^2C$ and serial RS-232.    

\chapter{Client and real world problem}
In this project I tackled the real world problem. I was developing solution to  The project supervisor was my client at the same time so that I could ask questions
