\end{center}

Computer Science department at Aberystwyth University has a large all-terrain rover that is equipped with a panoramic camera mounted on a Pan-and-Tilt Unit (PTU) that is stabilised using gyroscopes. One of the problems of the gyroscopes is that they tend to drift and therefore need to be regularly corrected to ensure the camera stays vertical. In order to fix this issue a small hardware module will be built and corresponding software developed. Complete system will interface tilt sensor (inclinometer) with the PTU to ensure camera "verticality". In this report root of the problem will be analysed, possible solutions and algorithms used to calculate PTU drift rate presented.
