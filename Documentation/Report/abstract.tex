\end{center}

Computer Science department at Aberystwyth University has a large all-terrain rover that is equipped with a panoramic camera mounted on a Pan-and-Tilt Unit (PTU) that is stabilised using gyroscopes. One of the problems of the gyroscopes is that they tend to drift and therefore need to be regularly corrected to ensure the camera stays vertical. The project is about building a small hardware module and the software to drive it that will interface tilt sensor (inclinometer) with the PTU to ensure camera "verticality".
