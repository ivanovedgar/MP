I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the guidance for this project given by Fred Labrosse over the last few months. Despite the busy schedule, he has always been ready to meet me and discuss my concerns. 

I would also like to thank Ian Izett and Peter, two wonderful technicians at the DSL lab who provided help with the hardware and kindly answered my questions.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family who have guided me in completing this study and have always been there for me.
