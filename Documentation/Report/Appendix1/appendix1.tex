The WiringPi project has been used to read and write data on I$^2$C bus as part of the interaction with the gpio14 chip. The library is open source and it is available from the Gordons Projects website: http://wiringpi.com/ . Installation is covered on this web page: http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/ . Before the I$^2$C interface can be used I$^2$C drivers need to be load into the kernel, guide is available at the http://wiringpi.com/reference/i2c-library/ .
